# Sudoku-Solver

This codebase includes the software that utilizes image processing techniques to solve Sudoku puzzles from images. The solver uses a combination of edge detection, thresholding, and contour extraction to identify the puzzle in the image and extract the individual cells. The puzzle is then passed to a backtracking algorithm to find the solution.
